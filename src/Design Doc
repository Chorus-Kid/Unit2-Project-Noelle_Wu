(insert importing math class thing here)
LinearEquations class:
instance variables:
private int firstX - first x coordinate
private int firstY - first y coordinate
private int secondX - second x coordinate
private int secondY - second y coordinate
private double x3 - third x coordinate for later shhhhhh

Constructors
public LinearEquation (x1, y1, x2, y2)
 this constructor will set up the first linear equation{
firstX = x1
firstY = y1
secondX = x2
secondY = y2
}
public LinearEquation (thirdX)
 this constructor will set up the second linear equation based on the x value the user inputs{
x3 = thirdX
}

methods
public double slope()
this method will calculate and return the slope


public double yIntercept()
this method will calculate and return the y-intercept


public String equation()
this method will return everything needed in a linear equation


public double distance()
this method will return the distance between the two points to the nearest hundredth


public String secret coordinate ()
this method will print out the secret coordinate using the same equation given the third x coordinate the user typed in

public String toString()
this method will print out the two coordinate pairs, the slope, the y intercept, the linear equation of the two lines, and the distance between the two points

EquationRunner.Java:
Step 1: Welcome!
Step 2: Ask user to input first coordinate point
Step 3: Ask user to input second coordinate point
Step 4: Do all necessary calculations in the background
Step 5: toString everything
Step 6: Ask user for 3rd x coordinate
Step 7: Print out y = equation for the 3rd x coordinate
