LinearEquations class:
instance variables:
private int x1 - first x coordinate
private int y1 - first y coordinate
private int x2 - second x coordinate
private int y2 - second y coordinate
private double x3 - third x coordinate for later shhhhhh

Constructor public LinearEquation (firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY) {
x1 = firstX
y1 = firstY
x2 = secondX
y2 = secondY
}

methods
public double slope( firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will calculate the slope
{
double slope = (secondY - firstY) / (secondX - firstX)
return slope
}

public double y-intercept( firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will calculate the y-intercept
{
return y-intercept
}

public String equation(slope, y-intercept)
this method will return everything needed in a linear equation
{
return equation
}

public String secret coordinate (x3)
this method will print out the secret coordinate using the same equation given the third x coordinate the user typed in
{
return secretCoordinate
}

public String
