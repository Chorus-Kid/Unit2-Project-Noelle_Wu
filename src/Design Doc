(insert importing math class thing here)
LinearEquations class:
instance variables:
private int x1 - first x coordinate
private int y1 - first y coordinate
private int x2 - second x coordinate
private int y2 - second y coordinate
private double x3 - third x coordinate for later shhhhhh

Constructor public LinearEquation (firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY) {
x1 = firstX
y1 = firstY
x2 = secondX
y2 = secondY
}

methods
public double slope( firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will calculate and return the slope


public double yIntercept( firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will calculate and return the y-intercept


public String equation(firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will return everything needed in a linear equation


public double distance(firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will return the distance between the two points to the nearest hundredth


public String secret coordinate (x3, firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
this method will print out the secret coordinate using the same equation given the third x coordinate the user typed in

public String toString()
this method will print out the two coordinate pairs, the slope, the y intercept, the linear equation of the two lines, and the distance between the two points

EquationRunner.Java:
Step 1: Welcome!
Step 2: Ask user to input first coordinate point
Step 3: Ask user to input second coordinate point
Step 4: Do all necessary calculations in the background
Step 5: toString everything
Step 6: Ask user for 3rd x coordinate
Step 7:
